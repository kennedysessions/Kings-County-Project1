	<p> Although Vice President Kamala Harris overwhelmingly won Kings County, data from the New York State Board of Elections show Democrats lost thousands of supporters when compared to the 2020 Presidential Election. </p>

	<p> Out of the 787,709 voters who cast their ballots on Tuesday, 551,633 voted for Harris, while 219,335 voted for Trump. And 16,741 voters decided to go with neighter candidate and write in a third choice instead.</p>

	<p> Thousands of people decided to stay home this election with 787,709 Brooklynnites voted casting their ballots while while 920,380 voted in 2024. 

	<p> Voting results show in 2020, Biden and Harris secured 703,310 votes from Democratic and Working Families Party voters. While Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence secured 202,772 votes from the Republican and Conservative Party voters, an overall lost of 7 percentage points.</p>

	<p> Kings County Conservative Party Chair Fran Vella-Marrone described the numbers as a "rightward shift" that's been building since 2021.</p>

	<p>"From what I've seen since 2021, the shift voting Republican and Conservative is happening, and itâ€™s happening in southern Brooklyn very intensely," Vella-Marrone said. "And I know that because we've been winning race after race. Every year we pick up another seat at least. So something is happening there."</p>
